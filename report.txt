1. Title Page
Project Title: Carbon Credit Tracker – A Web-Based Carbon Credit Management System


2. Abstract
The Carbon Credit Tracker is a robust, web-based application designed to streamline the process of monitoring, managing, and allocating carbon credits within organizations. With growing global awareness around climate change and sustainability, companies are increasingly looking for systems that promote and reward eco-friendly commuting and operations. This project leverages modern web technologies to facilitate transparent carbon credit tracking, integrates real-time geolocation services for validating commutes, and implements a secure, role-based access model.

This system enables employees to log their daily eco-friendly commutes, such as walking, cycling, or public transport usage. Employers can monitor these logs, allocate carbon credits based on predefined criteria, and generate reports for internal review or sustainability audits. An administrative module ensures proper onboarding and approval of organizations while maintaining system integrity. The entire application is built with a three-tier architecture using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance.

3. Introduction
3.1 Background
The detrimental impacts of climate change have led to an increased focus on reducing carbon emissions. One method of incentivizing lower emissions is through the use of carbon credits, which quantify reductions and allow them to be traded or offset against emissions. However, most organizations still rely on outdated, manual methods to track and manage these credits. These methods are inefficient, error-prone, and lack real-time oversight.

This project introduces the Carbon Credit Tracker, a digital platform that automates and simplifies the process of logging, validating, and managing carbon credits within organizations. Through intuitive interfaces and automated geolocation validation, this platform aims to bring transparency, efficiency, and security to carbon management efforts.

3.2 Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:

To develop a user-centric platform for employees to log eco-friendly commute data.

To enable employers to track sustainability metrics and manage carbon credit distributions.

To create an administrative interface for managing system-wide access and organizational approvals.

To incorporate geolocation services for validating commute distance and authenticity.

To enforce strict role-based access control, ensuring data privacy and secure user experiences.

4. System Analysis
4.1 Existing System
In many companies, tracking sustainable commuting practices is often done through spreadsheets or manual forms. These systems are:

Time-consuming to manage.

Prone to human error and fraud.

Not scalable for medium-to-large enterprises.

Lacking real-time insights and actionable analytics.

Inefficient at validating claimed commutes or estimating carbon credit equivalence.

4.2 Proposed System
The proposed Carbon Credit Tracker system is a fully web-based solution that offers:

Real-Time Tracking: Employees can log trips immediately, with the data available to employers instantly.

Automated Credit Calculation: Commutes are analyzed based on distance and mode of transport to generate carbon credit values.

Role-Based Dashboards: Personalized interfaces for employees, employers, and administrators.

Geolocation Integration: Utilizes APIs to verify distances between home and work addresses.

Secure Access Control: Each user’s access is governed by their role using JWT-based authentication.

5. System Design
5.1 Architecture Overview
The system employs a three-tier architecture:

Frontend (Client Tier): Built using React.js, it provides an interactive and responsive user interface.

Backend (Application Tier): Developed with Node.js and Express.js, it handles business logic, API routes, and user management.

Database (Data Tier): Uses MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability in storing user data, logs, and carbon credit information.
