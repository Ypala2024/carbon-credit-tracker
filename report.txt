## 2. Abstract

The Carbon Credit Tracker is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management and tracking of carbon credits within organizations. It enables employees to log eco-friendly trips, employers to monitor and manage carbon credits, and administrators to oversee the approval process of organizations. The system integrates geolocation features to validate commuting distances and employs a role-based access control mechanism to ensure secure and appropriate access to functionalities.

## 3. Introduction

### 3.1 Background

With the increasing emphasis on reducing carbon footprints, organizations are seeking efficient ways to monitor and manage their carbon emissions. Carbon credits serve as a mechanism to incentivize eco-friendly practices. This project aims to provide a streamlined platform for tracking and managing these credits.

### 3.2 Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly interface for employees to log eco-friendly trips.
- Enable employers to monitor employee activities and manage carbon credits.
- Implement an administrative module for approving organizations.
- Integrate geolocation features to validate trip distances.
- Ensure secure access through role-based authentication.

## 4. System Analysis

### 4.1 Existing System

Traditional methods of tracking carbon credits are often manual and prone to errors. There's a lack of real-time data and integration, leading to inefficiencies.

### 4.2 Proposed System

The proposed system offers:

- Real-time tracking of eco-friendly trips.
- Automated calculation of carbon credits based on trip data.
- Role-based dashboards for employees, employers, and administrators.
- Geolocation integration for validating trip distances.
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
