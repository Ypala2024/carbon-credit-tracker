2. Platform Overview

2.1 Business context
The Carbon Credit Tracker is support for corporate social responsibility, enabling organizations to make less of an imprint on the planet through sustainable commuting efforts. It empowers organizations to help employees make better choices for the environment, track carbon avoided, and tie it in with other sustainability efforts. In conjunction with functionality to have organizations implement incentive mechanisms that actually reward green commuting options, the platform is designed to support companies who want to help the environment.

2.2 Core functionality
The platform offers role based user registration for employees, administrators and system administrators, meaning each type of user will have different capabilities of what they can access. Employees will be prompted to log their eco commutes daily, which the system will verify to provide a carbon-neutral equivalency calculation. That carbon avoided will then be converted to carbon credits. Employers can then manage the distribution of credits and review sustainability metrics, while analytics can provide detail on an individual and an organization or group sustainability impact. Administrative capabilities will help facilitate governance of the system and platform adherence.


2.3 Users
Employees:
Employees log their commute data, track personal carbon savings, and earn carbon credits. Employees can also update their personal information, to ensure accurate reporting and rewards.

Employers
These users manage employee engagement, approve commute data, allocate credits, and report on sustainability developments. They are also responsible for user accounts in their organization.

System Administrators:
System Administrators manage the overall platform, verify organizations, manage the system's security, and review global analytics. They will manage user permissions and the overall capabilities of the system.

3. System Architecture
3.1 Architectural Overview
The Carbon Credit Tracker employs modern layered architecture that divides concerns into clear client-side and server-side implementations. The Carbon Credit Tracker utilizes a RESTful approach with three layers: user interface, business logic, and data, to improve maintainability and scalability.

3.2 Technology Stack
3.2.1 Frontend Technologies
The client-side application is developed using React (v19.1) for rendering the UI with React Router (v7.5) used for navigation. Axios is implemented for securely communicating with the API, Recharts is used for data visualization, and Redux manages application state.

3.2.2 Backend Technologies 
The server-side is built on Express (v5.1) and document storage is performed with MongoDB. Object modeling is handled by Mongoose (v8.13), while JWT and BCrypt are being used for secure user authentication and password encryption.

3.3 Infrastructure Component 
The infrastructure component of the platform includes the web servers that handle the delivery of the frontend content, application servers that handle the logic, and clustered databases that handle storage and data. Load balancers handle incoming requests, content delivery networks (CDNs) to handle static assets, and monitoring services handle performance and reliability metrics.

3.4 Communication Patterns
Communication follows standard RESTful practices over HTTPS. The system uses Mongoose for database interactions, JWT for session-based authentication, and React-based event handling for frontend user interaction.
